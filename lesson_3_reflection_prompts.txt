When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    So more more people can work on the repo and to access from another
    computer or device.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You do not want to pull changes submitted by other people as there might
    be conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork makes a copy of a repo on github, when you intend to branch off from
    master to add a feature and collaborate but do not intent to add to
    the master.
    Clone is to just make a copy of a Github repository
    Branches is to break away from master to make changes, you can merge a
    branch back.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    so you know from what poin to add or merge out of synce commits

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Work on the same live code or dev code, only only person allowed to
    checkout a page. easy enough, cant create conflicts although slower
    because cant work in parallel and merge later

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Just using master is quicker and no conflicts however more difficult
    to coolaborate at the same time.
